large_files_create
==================

Do you have too much disk space?
Do you wish for the old days when individual files consumed significant portions of your total disk size?
Well good news! This utility will let you create large, usually contiguous, files of arbitrary size. So easy to use you'll think it's 1985 all over again.

Specify the file size on the command-line and a list of file names to create. If no file size is given it defaults to 2146435072 (hahaa! good luck working out where that number came from).

The releases were built with VC++ 2012, so you'll need the supporting runtime from Microsoft:
